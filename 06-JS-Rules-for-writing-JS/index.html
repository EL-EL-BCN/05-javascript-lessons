	<h1>Rules for writing Javascript</h1>

	<p>1. Best practice is to terminate code with a ;</p>
	<p>2. To add a line of comment use // before the line</p>
	<p>3. To comment out a section of code start with /* before the section and finish with */ after the section.</p>
	<p>4. Javascript is case sensative. i.e. if we define a varibale as var names = "Elliott"; then we reference the variable alert(Names); it won't work.</p>
	<p>5.When naming variables that have two word names we do not seperate the words with a space but capitalise the first letter of the second word. i.e. name list would be var nameList.</p>
	<p>6.We have a type of variable called constants which we use capital letters for i.e. const NAMES.</p>
	<p>7.Whitespace in code does not matter, it is there to make it easier to read for humans. i.e. document.body.innerHTML = "xfjnbnbub";var name ="Elliott"; this code should be on two lines to make it easier to read.</p>
